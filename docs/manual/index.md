`finix` is an experimental Linux distribution built around the `nix` package manager. It uses [`finit`](https://github.com/finit-project/finit) instead of `systemd` as its init system and service supervisor. By default, it seeks to be:

- minimal
- unopinionated
- *extremely* flexible

`finix` is fully capable as a:

- daily-drivable desktop/laptop
- homelab server
- media center
- gaming pc
- ... and more!

## `finix` is not a fork

`finix` is an independent distribution that tries to remain similar to NixOS in how an end user configures their system, but with one key difference: while NixOS imports all available configuration modules by default, `finix` only imports a small handful of defaults essential for a bootable system. The end user is responsible for importing the rest of the modules required to configure their system to their specifications. A welcome side effect of this smaller selection of default imports is greatly reduced evaluation times. Minimal defaults, alongside `finix's` "assume nothing about the user" philosophy, and its preference for remaining as close to upstream authors in its software configuration as much as possible, means that an average `finix` system is (usually) much lighter than a similarly configured NixOS system (and more hackable!). Refer to [Comparing `finix` and NixOS](./finix-vs-nixos.md) for a more detailed comparison between `finix` and NixOS.

Contributions to the `finix` ecosystem are always welcome. If you would like to improve this documentation, contribute a software module, or make any improvements to core `finix` functionality, you are more than welcome to do so.
