> `finix` - a daily-drivable experimental os, featuring [finit](https://github.com/finit-project/finit) as pid 1, to explore the NixOS design space

While exploring the NixOS design space I had several topics in mind:

- [NixOS evaluation speed regression](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/79943)
- [NixOS always imports all modules](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/137168)
- [modular services](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/372170)
- [decoupling services](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/pre-rfc-decouple-services-using-structured-typing/58257)
- [NixNG](https://github.com/nix-community/NixNG)
- [sixos](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sixos-a-nix-os-without-systemd/58141)
- [nixbsd](https://github.com/nixos-bsd/nixbsd)

Now that `finix` is running on my laptop I have a working base for experimentation. More to come.

An example of defining a `finit` service in `nix`:

```
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  finit.services.network-manager = {
    description = "network manager service";
    runlevel = "2345";
    conditions = "service/syslogd/ready";
    command = "${pkgs.networkmanager}/bin/NetworkManager -n";
  };
}
```

`finix` is currently running on my ~spare~ primary laptop:

- with `finit` instead of `systemd` as the init system
- with `seatd` instead of `elogind` as the seat manager
- with `mdevd` instead of `eudev` as the device manager
- using [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) as my `wayland` compositor

`finix` initially ran:
- in an `incus` container
- in a `nspawn` container
- on `virtualbox`
- with `x11`

None of the above methods have been attempted in some time.

# Getting Started

[Documentation](https://finix-community.github.io/finix)

`finix` does not yet have a disk image available to download - installation will need to take place from a standard NixOS image, which can be downloaded [here](https://nixos.org/download#nixos-iso). You may download and burn either the minimal image or the graphical image and the steps will remain the same. 

For an installation guide, see [Installation](https://finix-community.github.io/finix/installation.html) on our documentation site. Credits to [@xZecora](https://github.com/xZecora) for writing the referenced [examples](https://github.com/finix-community/examples).

# `cachix` binary cache

A binary cache is generously provided by the [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) free tier offering.

```nix
  services.nix-daemon.settings = {
    substituters = [ "https://finix.cachix.org" ];
    trusted-public-keys = [ "finix.cachix.org-1:0ejikHDeCp0UErsduUUHcg9IJczY2/h2e5132Z/As/c=" ];
  };
```
